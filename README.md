##TOPIC: Emotional AI



Humans are usually very good at recognizing emotions through facial expressions, tones, gestures etc. But, what about computers? Probably not so much... yet.
Your challenge is to build a model (from scratch or on top of an existing model) that is smart enough to recognize various emotions through voice or facial expressions. Find a movie, speech, or any other video source, use your model to extract the appropriate content, and then transform the section accordingly. You may add sound, text, visual elements, alter the voice or video background...anything you’d like, the only rule is to make sure the process is automated and the result is fun!
